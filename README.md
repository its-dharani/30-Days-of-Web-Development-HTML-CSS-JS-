# 30 Days Web Development Challenge

This repository contains my 30-day web development learning journey.
Each folder (DAY1–DAY30) contains the code and notes(README FILE) for that day.

Tech stack:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Why This Challenge?

I have learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through courses, YouTube videos, and tutorials.
However, I never truly felt confident building projects completely from scratch.
So to overcome this, I started this 30-day challenge, hopefully i must complete it.

## Goal:
- Learn fundamentals
- Build from scratch
- Stay consistent
- Come out of tutorial hell and actually build something
